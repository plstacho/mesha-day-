25/01/2026, 17:32 - Ethan: In days of yore, where castles stood,
A tale of hips, both strong and good,
Fair maiden moves with ancient grace,
Her hips a dance, a poet's embrace.

Chorus:
Hips that sway in candlelight,
A bard's delight, a wondrous sight,
In medieval halls they gleam,
Her hips, a mesmerizing dream.

Through meadows green and forests deep,
Her hips in rhythms, secrets keep,
With every step, a saga told,
In verses bright, in rhymes of gold.

Chorus:
Hips that sway in candlelight,
A bard's delight, a wondrous sight,
In medieval halls they gleam,
Her hips, a mesmerizing dream.

Beneath the moon, by starry streams,
Her hips inspire the sweetest dreams,
In troubadour's enchanting lore,
Her hips, a song forevermore.

Chorus:
Hips that sway in candlelight,
A bard's delight, a wondrous sight,
In medieval halls they gleam,
Her hips, a mesmerizing dream.

So ends this tale of hips divine,
In bardic verses, they entwine,
A timeless dance, a lullaby,
In echoes of a medieval sky

29/01/2026, 00:25 - Mesh <3: Ellooo
29/01/2026, 00:25 - Ethan: Why hello there
29/01/2026, 00:25 - Mesh <3: I have something I'm feeling insecure about
29/01/2026, 00:26 - Ethan: Whatsup?
29/01/2026, 00:26 - Mesh <3: Promise to tell me the truth?
29/01/2026, 00:26 - Ethan: Promise
29/01/2026, 00:26 - Mesh <3: You mentioned something about what the point is
29/01/2026, 00:26 - Ethan: Yeah
29/01/2026, 00:27 - Mesh <3: Like what the point of us being in a relationship is?
29/01/2026, 00:28 - Ethan: Like what's the point in being a relationship if one party can't dedicate the time and effort whereas the other party can, is what i meant
29/01/2026, 00:28 - Mesh <3: Ohhhh okay okay
29/01/2026, 00:28 - Ethan: Anything else?
29/01/2026, 00:28 - Mesh <3: I don't see it that way
29/01/2026, 00:29 - Ethan: Yeah?
29/01/2026, 00:29 - Ethan: Do tell
29/01/2026, 00:29 - Mesh <3: If we both like each other then that's the whole point
29/01/2026, 00:29 - Ethan: That's true
29/01/2026, 00:30 - Mesh <3: I understand that it's a concern of yours
29/01/2026, 00:30 - Ethan: We can manage if we actually like each other
29/01/2026, 00:31 - Mesh <3: But i see it as us both having something to work towards
29/01/2026, 00:31 - Mesh <3: And being patient enough to see the end of things if that makes sense
29/01/2026, 00:31 - Ethan: Yeah that makes a lot of sense
29/01/2026, 00:31 - Mesh <3: Nope just that :)
29/01/2026, 00:32 - Mesh <3: I was scared you didn't see where we could go
29/01/2026, 00:32 - Mesh <3: And that all of this up to this point was just like fun
29/01/2026, 00:32 - Ethan: Oh my god no 😭
29/01/2026, 00:32 - Ethan: Pls 😭
29/01/2026, 00:33 - Mesh <3: Cause i like you more than i thought i did ;-;
29/01/2026, 00:33 - Mesh <3: I didn't think i would be able to continue with this if that was the case
29/01/2026, 00:33 - Ethan: Yeah I understand
29/01/2026, 00:34 - Ethan: I like you way more than i thought too
29/01/2026, 00:35 - Ethan: I only brought it up bc I wanted to let you know that at times I won't be able to give you the time and attention you need/want
29/01/2026, 00:35 - Mesh <3: I'm okay with that
29/01/2026, 00:35 - Ethan: Yk implying a low maintenance relationship for now
29/01/2026, 00:36 - Mesh <3: We both have our own lives to live
29/01/2026, 00:36 - Ethan: Yeah we do
29/01/2026, 00:36 - Ethan: Both our own dreams
29/01/2026, 00:36 - Mesh <3: It's not like being in a relationship will automatically make it the crux of our lives
29/01/2026, 00:36 - Ethan: Yeah exactly
29/01/2026, 00:36 - Ethan: You're right
29/01/2026, 00:37 - Mesh <3: Yeah i understand and I'd like that too
29/01/2026, 00:37 - Ethan: Okay :)
29/01/2026, 00:38 - Mesh <3: We didn't expect this as well so I just want to let you know that i won't mind if you put more time into what you want to do
